    <p>Contemporary art scene in Rome is very vivid, almost every week throughout the year, we can attend different interesting show openings. The range goes from institutional events in public museums and spaces, to those in private galleries, more intimate but with high social relevance. Recently a new trend brought multifunctional places for culture promotion in to focus as well.

Like in other large cities with important contemporary art reality, galleries in Rome are organized clusters almost like nucleus that live near to each other. Sometimes many have show openings on the same day, usually Thursdays, so you could have true “art-walks” in historical centre or in other parts of the city like Trastevere, Ghetto, or Piazza Flaminio.
