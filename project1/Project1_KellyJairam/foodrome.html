  <p>A walking tour will tend to have a group of people following a leader around, looking at specific sites, hearing about history of of those sites and of the city in general. A food tour involves walking around a neighborhood, going into shops and restaurants to try various foods, and hearing both about the foods themselves and how they fit into the city’s culture.

A food tour is often a smaller group of people, but also tends to cost more. That cost goes into the multiple food tastings along your route. Food tours can still have a healthy component of walking involved, but this is ok. That time is useful to digest and spread out the amount of food. Think of having a multiple course meal spread out not only over several hours,but a number of locations.

There is usually plenty of food to go around. On average on the tours we have been on have 6-7 stops, each with a small plate of food. You start at the first place and think that such a small plate won’t be enough, but after the 5th stop you start to wonder if you have enough room in your stomach. A word of wisdom here, don’t overeat on breakfast and don’t plan a big dinner after your tour. </p>
